#### 💊 Medical・Pharma LLM Projects
* [Foundation models × Healthcare network data](https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000012.000101360.html) is a collaborative research with Kyoto Univ. and EQUES Inc. Ongoing.
* [JPharmatron-7B](https://huggingface.co/collections/EQUES/jpharmatron-680a330b4dfce3ac43009984) is the first Japanese pharmaceutical domain specific LLM, developed along with new benchamrks [JPharmaBench](https://huggingface.co/collections/EQUES/jpharmabench-680a34acfe96870e41d050d8). A work at EQUES Inc.
* [Japanese Medical Language Model Evaluation Harness](https://github.com/stardust-coder/japanese-lm-med-harness) is the evaluation codes and leaderboard for medical LLMs. A work at AIST KAKUSEI.
* [MedSwallow](https://huggingface.co/AIgroup-CVM-utokyohospital/MedSwallow-70b) is the second Japanese medical LLM finetuned from Swallow-70b-instruct-hf. A work at UTokyo Hospital.
* [JMedLoRA](https://huggingface.co/AIgroup-CVM-utokyohospital/llama2-jmedlora-3000) is the first Japanese medical LLM finetuned from Llama2. A work at UTokyo Hospital.
* [awesome-latest-LLM](https://github.com/stardust-coder/awesome-latest-LLM) is the curation of the latest and competent LLMs, including medical domain adaptation. Personal work. 

#### 🗒 Statistics Projects
* [Minimum information Markov model](https://github.com/stardust-coder/min-info-markov) is a brand new Markov model that models the marginal stationary distribution and the dependence function seperately. 
* [Sparse Torus Graph Modeling × EEG](https://github.com/stardust-coder/torus_graph_modelling) introduces a high-dimensional circular model with regularization to estimate dependence structure behind EEG phase, i.e., phase-based connectivity.
* [Minimum Information Copula](https://github.com/stardust-coder/minimum-information-copula) is the library that numerically calculates the density function of minimum information copula, the most natural copula under predetermined constraints. 
* [OGI (objective general index) implementation in Python](https://github.com/stardust-coder/objective-general-index) is the Python implementation of [Sei (2016)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047259X16000269).
