This is Issey Sukeda. Currently, I am a D1 student under the supervision of Prof. Tomonari Sei and Prof. Takeru Matsuda, supported by RIKEN and KAKUSEI (AIST).  

My research direction is to model constraints behind multivariate time series data, leveraging on entropy and information.  
My full publications can be accessed from [Publications](https://stardust-coder.github.io/myportfolio/page/publication/).  
Currently, I am working on 
- Copulas and information
- Graphical modelling and directional statistics for EEG
- Japanese medical language (and vision) model development

Any collaboration or discussion is welcome !
